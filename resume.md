### ECE 110 Honors Project: Walk-In Lights *(Spring 2018)*

[View project on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/roshinis/ece110_honorsproject)

- Automated a small-scale motion activated, efficient lighting system using Arduino.
- Successfully designed and tested the full Arduino code used to implement the system.
- Significantly reduced the energy consumption of the LED by using Arduino's millis() to control the timing of the light's on cycle.  
- Used this same method to also precisely detect motion despite an inconsistent motion sensor.
