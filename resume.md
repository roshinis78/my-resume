## Projects

All public projects can be viewed at [my GitHub](https://github.com/roshinis78).

### Plant-based Dining in the U.S. Visualization *(Spring 2019)*

[View project on GitHub](https://github.com/roshinis78/plantbased-dining)

- Drafted and designed a map visualization to explore U.S. plant-based dining options with a focus on affordability and cuisines.
- Utilized pandas and Python to clean the original dataset and to parse the restaurant website list to obtain usable links.
- Generated an SVG path to draw an equirectangular projection of GeoJSON data for the U.S. with the help of D3.js.
- Created custom interactive tooltips to display useful restaurant information and to redirect viewers to further resources.

### Crazy Taxi on FPGA *(Spring 2019)*

[View project on GitHub](https://github.com/roshinis78/crazy-taxi-info)

-	Successfully redesigned and recreated a 2D car racing game on the FPGA for use with a VGA monitor and a USB keyboard.
-	Designed all in-game sprites and wrote a Python script to map 24-bit colors to a palette for efficient use of On-Chip Memory.
-	Created a finite state machine to control transitions between the start screen, game world, winner screen and end credits.
-	Additionally, implemented multiplayer support for up to two players, world scrolling, collision handling, random obstacle generation, dynamic on-screen scores, smooth visual transitions between game states, and increasing game difficulty.

### Panic at the Kernel OS *(Fall 2018)*

-	Collaborated with a three-student team to design and implement an operating system using x86 Assembly and C.
-	Developed interrupt handling with assembly linkage for exceptions and hardware interrupts (keyboard, RTC, PIT).
-	Implemented full read-only file system functionality and supported execution of user-level programs. 
-	Designed a comprehensive set of unit tests to quickly find bugs and ensure proper functionality for all components. 


### ECE 110 Honors Project: Walk-In Lights *(Spring 2018)*

[View project on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/roshinis/ece110_honorsproject)

- Automated a small-scale motion activated, efficient lighting system using Arduino.
- Successfully designed, implemented, & tested the full Arduino code. 
-	Significantly reduced energy consumption of the LED by taking advantage of Arduino‚Äôs millis().  
- Used this same method to save 10$ on replacing our inconsistent motion detector.
 
## Work Experience 

### Computer Systems Engineering (ECE 391) Undergraduate Assistant	*(Spring 2019 - present)*
- Creating a supportive office hours environment to help students master course material (x86 ISA, interrupt support, synchronization, file systems, VGA, scheduling) and overcome bugs and conceptual challenges when writing code.
- Using classification and regression trees to categorize ECE 391 Queue data and display insights on an interactive visualization.

### Introduction to Electronics (ECE 110) Course Aide *(Fall 2018)*  

- Managed an electronics lab of 40 students and helped them analyze and overcome technical challenges.
- Aided students with their final project designs involving sensors (including phototransistors and ultrasonic sensors) and provided insight and useful resources for students developing code for Arduino.

### Self Employed Highschool Math Tutor *(Fall 2016 - Summer 2018)* 

- Tutored high school students in Algebra/Algebra 2/Precalculus with a 100% course advancement test pass rate. 
- Provided them with a fundamentally conceptual and visual understanding of any formulas and topics in the course and in applications of the course.
